## About Project

This project represents an innovative online marketplaceâ€”a bustling hub where both customers and previously underserved sellers converge. As an all-in-one platform, it seamlessly bridges the gap between those seeking services and products and those eager to offer them. The heart of this ecosystem lies in its Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), which beautifully illustrates the intricate connections between buyers, sellers, and the array of offerings. Imagine it as a vibrant tapestry woven with threads of commerce, community, and convenience.
